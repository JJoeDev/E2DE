# E2DE (Ego 2D Engine)

This is a simple 2D game engine that I am making at the moment because I have wanted to do it for quite a while

The engine is not supposed to compete against other engines like Unity, Godot, or GDevelop, it is only supposed to be something I use for small 2D games, but lets see how long that stays true

## What is this exactly?

E2DE is a simple game engine I am writing in C++ to learn more complex C++ topics and to get a bigger project on github. But it is also because I love a challenge and for the last year i have been making small games in frameworks like SDL2 Raylib and SFML.

Now they are all awesome and good frameworks, some easier than others. But I want a "higher level" framework that can do more with less code, that is why I am developing E2DE. But I do have plans on making it a full on engine in the future once I am comfortable with the featureset of the engine.
